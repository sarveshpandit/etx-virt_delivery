# VMs and GitOps

In this exercise we will create VMs and pods using OpenShift GitOps. We will also configure a network policy to control the traffic between the VM and the pod.

[NOTE]
====
Many of the commands in this module use variable subscitutions, which will identified by curly braces.  For example, you will need to replace `{your_github_yser}` with your GitHub user name in the next section.
====

## Clone the GitOps repository

To run this exercise we need to fork and clone the course git repo. 
The course git repo is located at `https://github.com/juliovp01/etx-virt_delivery`.
Log in to GitHub, navigate to this page, and fork the repo to your own account.

Then clone the repo to your bastion VM with the following commands.

[source,console,subs="attributes"]
---
$ git clone https://github.com/{your_github_user}/etx-virt_delivery

$ cd etx-virt_delivery

## Install the OpenShift GitOps Operator

This Openshift environment does not have Argo CD already deployed. So we have to deploy it.
Run the following commands on your bastion VM.

[source,console,subs="attributes"]
---
$ oc adm new-project openshift-gitops
Created project openshift-gitops

$ oc apply -f content/gitops/bootstrap/subscription.yaml
subscription.operators.coreos.com/openshift-gitops-operator created

$ oc apply -f content/gitops/bootstrap/cluster-rolebinding.yaml
clusterrolebinding.rbac.authorization.k8s.io/cluster-admin-gitops-sc created
---

Check the *Installed Operators* in your OpenShift console to verify that the *Red Hat OpenShift GitOps* operator was successfully installed.

image::VMs-and-gitops/gitops-installed.png[link=self, window=blank, width=100%]

Open the ArgoCD console by clicking on the applications menu (3x3 boxes symbol) in the OpenShift console and selecting *Cluster Argo CD*.

image::VMs-and-gitops/argocd-instance.png[link=self, window=blank, width=100%]

Choose *LOG IN VIA OPENSHIFT* and enter your OpenShift credentials:

* *User:* {openshift_cluster_admin_username}
* *Password:* {openshift_cluster_admin_password}

When prompted to authorize access, click on *Allow selected permissions*.  The ArgoCD console will be shown.

## Deploy the Argo CD Instance

Let's deploy the Argo CD instance. In this case we are going to deploy the default Argo CD instance, but in a real world scenario , you might have to design for multitenancy, in which case you might end up needing more than one instance. Run the following commands.

[source,console,subs="attributes"]
---
$ export gitops_repo=https://github.com/{your_github_user}/etx-virt_delivery.git

$ export cluster_base_domain=$(oc get ingress.config.openshift.io cluster --template={{.spec.domain}} | sed -e "s/^apps.//")

$ export platform_base_domain=${cluster_base_domain#*.}

$ envsubst < content/gitops/bootstrap/argocd.yaml | oc apply -f -
Warning: resource argocds/openshift-gitops is missing the kubectl.kubernetes.io/last-applied-configuration annotation which is required by oc apply. oc apply should only be used on resources created declaratively by either oc create --save-config or oc apply. The missing annotation will be patched automatically.
argocd.argoproj.io/openshift-gitops configured
configmap/setenv-cmp-plugin created
configmap/environment-variables created
group.user.openshift.io/cluster-admins created
---

// Verify that the Argo CD instance was correctly deployed.

## Deploy the gitops root Application

We are going to deploy two applications in the same namespace: one VM and one pod. The pod will be able to talk to the VM, but the VM will not be able to talk to the pod.

To do so we are going to employ the https://argo-cd.readthedocs.io/en/stable/operator-manual/cluster-bootstrapping/#app-of-apps-pattern[app of apps pattern]. In this pattern, we have a root application that deploys other applications. 

The root application will look for applications to deploy in the `content/gitops/applications` directory.

Deploy the root application by running the following command.

[source,console,subs="attributes"]
---
$ envsubst < content/gitops/bootstrap/appset.yaml | oc apply -f -
applicationset.argoproj.io/root-applications created
---

Notice that we have implemented the app of apps pattern with the an https://argo-cd.readthedocs.io/en/stable/operator-manual/applicationset/[ApplicationSet].

In the ArgoCD console, verify that the two child applications have been correctly deployed.  (It may take a minute or so for the status of both applications to become healthy and synced.

image::VMs-and-gitops/appset-working.png[link=self, window=blank, width=100%]

## Verify the deployed applications and traffic policies

Examine the network policies that were created

[source,console,subs="attributes"]
---
$ oc get networkpolicy -n gitops-test
NAME                          POD-SELECTOR   AGE
allow-from-ingress-to-nginx   app=nginx      10m
apache-network-policy         app=apache     10m
---

* The nginx pod only accepts traffic from the openshift-ingress namespace. This means that we can create a route for it.
* The apache VM only accepts traffic from pods in the same namespace, including the nginx pod.

Within your OpenShift console, log in to the console of the `fedora-apache` VM, and run the following commands.

[source,console,subs="attributes"]
---
$ sudo -i # to become root

# dnf install -y httpd

# systemctl enable httpd --now
---

Now the VM is listening on port 80.

From your bastion VM, run the following command to get the service IPs.

[source,console,subs="attributes"]
---
$ export nginx_ip=$(oc get svc nginx -n gitops-test -o jsonpath='{.spec.clusterIP}')

$ export apache_ip=$(oc get svc apache -n gitops-test -o jsonpath='{.spec.clusterIP}')
---

Verify that the nginx pod can talk to the apache VM.

[source,console,subs="attributes"]
---
$ export nginx_pod_name=$(oc get pod -n gitops-test -l app=nginx -o jsonpath='{.items[0].metadata.name}')

$ oc exec -n gitops-test $nginx_pod_name -- curl -s http://${apache_ip}:80
---

Verify that the apache VM cannot talk to the nginx pod.  You will need the IP address of the nginx service.

[source,console,subs="attributes"]
---
$ echo $nginx_ip
172.31.208.10
---

[NOTE]
====
The IP address of the nginx service will be different in your environment.  Be sure to use the correct IP address in the next step.
====

Then from the machine console run the following command:

[source,console,subs="attributes"]
---
$ curl -v http://{replace_with nginx_ip}:8080
---
